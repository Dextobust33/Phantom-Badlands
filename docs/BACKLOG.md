# Phantom Badlands — Master Backlog

**The single ordered to-do list.** Read it before proposing what to work on; update it as work
lands. Items are ordered so each one's inputs are settled before it starts — working out of order
is what forces revisits.

History lives in `docs/archive/BACKLOG_journal_to_2026-09-07.md`. Search it before re-opening
anything: it records why several approaches were REJECTED, and re-proposing those is the most
common way to lose a session.

---

## Where the game is (2026-09-07)

Live: **v0.9.759** (client + server).

- **Card upgrades are no longer offered where they cannot work.** Four (`swift`, `sacrificial`,
  `vindication`, `refund`) needed damage or a kill but were marked `KIND_ANY`, so a milestone
  spent on them from a buff card was simply lost. `-- upgradefit` casts every card with and
  without every upgrade it can be offered: dead pairs 71 -> 8.
- **Four audits gate the class surfaces**: `cardaudit` (what a card SAYS), `enginenames` (meter,
  log, label), `statdesc` (stat lines), `upgradefit` (do upgrades do anything). Three PASS.
- **Read `upgradefit`'s docstring before trusting it.** It was wrong four times before it was
  right, and every wrong version produced output indistinguishable from a real finding.

- **One name and one number per thing.** A day of player reports turned out to be one shape nine
  times over: a value stated in two places, drifting. Card faces vs hovers, the Trickster meter
  tag, stat pools, racial passives (SIX copies), loot names, dungeon levels. Each was fixed at the
  precedence or the generator, not at the instance.
- **`-- namesweep`, `-- enginenames`, `-- statdesc`** cover all nine classes and fail loudly.

- **Cards tell the truth about their own damage.** The estimate counted `power` picks alone while
  nine more multipliers were applied, so four upgrades added 25-35% invisibly and Slow Burn took
  25% away with no visible change. One shared table now feeds the roller and the card face; the
  rank-up hover previews YOUR card with the pick on it. `-- upgradepreview` holds them to 0.007.
- **All nine engines have their own name** (Momentum / Rage / Conviction, Focus / Volatility /
  Insight, Leverage / Aim / Read). `-- enginenames` checks every surface, 9/9.
- **Every release now passes `tools/verify_release_build.sh`** before upload, which asserts the
  perf guards and catches the stale-export cache. v0.9.757 was the first through it.

- **All nine classes run one of three engine shapes**, one of each per archetype, with their own
  starter deck and their own card names. No two classes in a path play alike.
- **Difficulty ramps with level** (`DIFFICULTY_RAMP`): forgiving while a player learns, tightening
  as gear and skill accumulate.
- **Endgame is on target.** A best-in-slot player survives 95.6-99.1% of L100-L1000 fights against
  the owner's stated 95%. About 55% of those are outright wins and 36-42% are retreats.
- **Career survival, average gear** (`grow`, death per encounter): Fighter 0.2%, Sorcerer 0.2%,
  Wizard 0.2%, Paladin 0.3%, Grifter 0.3%, Ninja 0.7%, Barbarian 1.2%, Sage 1.3%, Ranger 1.9%.
- **Gear lockout is prevented**: `DROP_LEVEL_FLOOR_RATIO` floors item level at 75% of the player's,
  so farming below your level still yields gear near it.

---

## What "balanced" means here — read before any balance work

Owner, 2026-09-06/07. This supersedes win-rate parity, which was never the right target.

- **"Most characters die, that is the point."** Balance is not every class reaching the top.
- **AND** *"a careful player should be able to get there, with good gear, card upgrades, strong
  companion, and skilled play."* Both hold at once.
- *"Even with all of these things if a high level player isn't careful and takes on a challenge too
  great... they can still meet their end."*
- **Balanced does NOT mean equal kill speed.** Classes should feel different; players find their
  preference through playstyle.
- **95% survival** for endgame fights when playing as intended. Survival counts a RETREAT — knowing
  when to run is part of playing well.
- Fights must not get boring through **length OR lack of choices**. Never pad a fight: a turn with
  no decision only gets worse when repeated.

**The measurement consequence.** Death risk must FALL as progression accumulates; a single global
rate is the wrong model. At a CONSTANT rate the endgame is arithmetically unreachable, because a
climb to L10000 is ~177,000 encounters. Measure per stage AND per gear profile (`riskcurve`), never
as one number.

**Do not call reaching L20 "finishing the game."** It is ~0.3% of the ladder.

---

## How to work on balance without burning sessions

Both failed calibration chains on 2026-09-07 cost ~45 minutes each, and **neither failed because
the simulation was wrong** — it faithfully measured a broken instrument. Use the cheap audits:

| audit | ~time | answers |
|---|---|---|
| `preflight` | 2 min | **is the chain worth running?** decks are 5 cards, the two measurement paths agree, nobody idles |
| `lowlevel` | 2 min | are L1-L3 classes resource-starved or auto-attacking? |
| `riskcurve` | 4 min | death rate by level AND gear — does risk fall as you progress? |
| `endgame` | 4 min | the 95% target, at high n on the cells that decide it |
| `cardnames` / `statdesc` | instant | what each class is SHOWN about its cards and stats |
| `climbcost` | instant | encounters a climb costs, and the survival arithmetic |

**Iterate on those; run the chain ONCE at the end, gated by `preflight`.**

**A global player buff cannot fix a class gap.** The chain holds win rate at target, so any
across-the-board buff is cancelled by monsters getting stronger on the next refit. Only PER-CLASS
changes survive. Measured: a global CON mitigation buff washed out entirely on the next chain run,
while the Paladin's stat realignment held.

---

## Phase 1 — confirm the two releases landed (do first, cheap)

- [ ] **Watch the five live characters at L3-L12.** They sit in exactly the range everything shipped
      on 2026-09-07 targets, and they are now better evidence than more simulation.
      `bash tools/check_player_progress.sh` — at L25+ re-validate `make_char` against real saves;
      at L50+ the high-level balance work can finally be checked against real data.
- [x] **Deck repair CONFIRMED WORKING on live data — 2026-09-08.** It runs on character load, so
      it has fired on the two characters that have logged in since it shipped and not on the rest:
      * `Dexto` (Ranger L6, repair=1): exactly the 5-card Ranger starter.
      * `p3snarujuppo` (Ninja L9, repair=1): the 5-card Ninja starter + `companion_card_kelpie`,
        which the repair keeps ON PURPOSE (a drop the deck screen cannot re-add). It also holds
        `distract`, which is NOT a Ninja starter card — but `distract` is in the roster and
        re-addable from the deck screen, so that is a manual add after the repair, which is the
        documented intent ("players can customize manually again"). Not a defect; recorded because
        a 7-card deck looks like one at a glance.
      * The seven that have not logged in still read `deck_repair_version = -` with 7-13 card
        decks (`Caps2` 12, `CapsUndeadBarb` 13). They will repair on next login. Correct by design.
- [ ] **Feel check the rest change.** `REST_HEAL_MIN/MAX` replaced EIGHT sites, so meditate and
      companion regen scaled along with rest and mages got it twice. Owner: Meditate is the
      deliberate lever if mages come back too strong — check that BEFORE touching mage design.

## Phase 2 — balance follow-through (cheap audits, no chain)

- [ ] **Sage 1.3%, Barbarian 1.2%, Ranger 1.9%** death per encounter against 0.1-0.7% for the rest.
      Real but not broken, and all three clear the endgame bar. Per-class levers only.
- [ ] **The win targets at high level predate retreat.** 60% was chosen when a "loss" meant a death;
      it now mostly means a retreat. Revisit alongside the Unburied, since extra lives change what
      survival means. `refcal` REPORTS death rate now but cannot steer by it — at a ~0.3% target
      there is under one expected death per sample, so there is no signal to correct against.
- [x] **Magic Bolt damage vs investment — RESOLVED 2026-09-07** (`magecost` audit, n=40 through the
      real cast path). It is exactly the design asked for: **highest single-cast damage at every
      level** (452 / 1,743 / 6,368 at L10 / L50 / L200) and the **least mana-efficient card from L50
      onward** (11.8 dmg-per-mana against Meteor's 18.3 at L200). You burst with it and sustain with
      Blast or discharge with Meteor. Meteor's lead is understated: measured at ZERO Focus, and the
      discharge is its whole point.
      Residual, minor: at **L10** Bolt is both the biggest hit and marginally the most efficient
      (25.8 against Blast's 23.0). A 12% edge is a preference, not a trap — revisit only if early
      mages read as one-button.
- [x] **Overload RETIRED 2026-09-07** — owner approved removing it rather than re-pricing again.
      It was the only card that cost HEALTH in a game where health is the resource you die from,
      spent against a 30% retreat threshold, so no price worked: at 20% of max HP it cost the
      Sorcerer 81/53/65 -> 96/65/71, and re-priced to 12% it STILL gave 2/40 survivors against
      12/40 for the card it replaced. **Damage does not save you; hit points do.**
      Off the roster, migrated out of existing decks on load (same as `all_or_nothing`), and the
      cast path kept as a branch that TELLS a player who still has it bound rather than failing
      silently — the treatment Outsmart got. `-- verify` now asserts it REFUSES, since a retired
      card that still casts is the bug worth catching.
- [x] **Vestigial ability `level` fields — the PLAYER-FACING half fixed 2026-09-07.** Confirmed
      nothing gates on them: no resolver, sort or filter reads an ability's `level`. But they had
      leaked into the help page, which listed "L100 Devastate" and "L25 Shield Bash" a few lines
      above "all available from level 1" — a direct contradiction on the same screen, telling a new
      player they could not have their finisher until level 100. All 24 prefixes removed and the
      clarifier moved to the top of each list.
      The dict fields themselves are left in place: they are inert, and removing them touches every
      ability entry for no player-visible gain. If they are ever removed, do it in one pass and
      re-run `-- verify`.

## Phase 3 — combat UX debt (visible to every player, every fight)

- [ ] **Three card upgrades that do nothing on some cards** (found 2026-09-08 by `-- upgradefit`,
      which casts every card with and without every upgrade it can be offered and compares the
      result). The structural cause — four damage-only upgrades marked `KIND_ANY` — is FIXED; what
      is left are three separate wiring gaps, all pre-existing, none a regression:
      * **`opening_act` on Magic Bolt (all 3 mages) and Analyze** — it refunds
        `path_last_ability_cost`, which is recorded only in `apply_variable_cost`. Cards that do
        not take that path never set it, so the refund is zero. Fix belongs in the cost funnel,
        which several upgrades already modify — worth doing carefully rather than quickly.
      * **`vindication` on the Paladin's Judgement** — heals 6% on a killing blow, but the
        finisher's victory path appears to return before the upgrade block runs. Check
        `_process_victory` against the `vindication` site.
      * **`demoralising` / `harrying` on Analyze / Sabotage — RULED: they STAY, but see the
        dependency below.** They are gated on the enemy being stunned or distracted. Only the
        GRIFTER carries Distract; a Ranger (Track, Snare, Weak Point, Ambush, Killing Shot) and a
        Ninja (Mark, Hamstring, Ambush, Phantom Strike, Assassinate) hold no card that can rattle
        anything, so today these can only fire if the player first takes the `Disorienting` or
        `Pinning` upgrade elsewhere. Owner 2026-09-08: *"These can stay in but only if we ensure
        we do a good companion card pass... and a dungeon card pass... If those two are done
        properly a small portion of those could offer stun or distraction to make this a viable
        option."* So this is CONDITIONAL on the two card passes below.
      `-- upgradefit` is at 12 dead pairs of 1127, down from 71. **Read its docstring before
      trusting a run**: the audit was wrong four times before it was right (player pinned at full
      health, one cast per combat, not honouring the game's own exclusions, and buffs missing
      from the signature) and every wrong version produced output indistinguishable from a real
      finding.

- [x] **Character creation was stale — DONE 2026-09-07** (owner: *"Seems like it's not showing the
      correct classes or descriptions and some of the other info is dated."*). Three faults:
      the class button printed the raw id, so the list said "Sage" while the panel beneath it said
      "Oracle"; race passives had THREE copies and two had drifted (Dwarf's Last Stand advertised
      at 25% against a real 34%, the Halfling's +15% Valor attributed to monster kills when it is
      paid on market listings); and the screen predated the per-class engine work, so it pitched
      nine classes on flavour and a passive alone. It now shows "Builds: Rage / Conviction /
      Insight..." and the five cards you will actually hold under their per-class names, all read
      live. `Character.race_passive_for` is the new single source for races.
- [x] **Release perf guards can no longer be lost — DONE 2026-09-07** (owner: *"we need to find a
      solution so this is Always done with every new release without me having to tell you or
      correct it each time."*). `--buildverify` had existed since 2026-09-05 and **nothing ever ran
      it**. `tools/verify_release_build.sh` runs it against a packaged client and exits non-zero on
      a stale build or a missing guard; `max_fps` is now set from code beside vsync, since a
      setting living only in project.godot has no runtime assertion. Mandatory step in CLAUDE.md
      before upload. Verified by watching it BLOCK the stale 0.9.754 build.

- [x] **Buff/debuff visibility — SELF and ENEMY done 2026-09-07.** Party members still to do.
      Three gaps, all of them things the player could not see at all:
      - The **enemy's debuffs from the current card set** were never sent. Sabotage/Hamstring/Snare,
        Distract and Analyze/Track/Mark are most of the Trickster kit, and you had no way to know
        whether one landed or how big it was. Now sent and shown with magnitude.
      - Player buff chips showed **duration only** — "Iron Skin 4T" never said what it was worth.
        Now magnitude and duration.
      - **Most mitigation is not a buff**, so it appeared nowhere: CON grants it from the stat and
        the class engines grant it from banked stacks (Fighter Momentum, Sorcerer Volatility,
        Grifter Read). A Fighter now reads "-54% taken (Constitution 6%, Damage reduction 48%,
        Momentum 5%)". This also makes SPENDING engine stacks legible, since spending gives the
        mitigation up.
      Computed by `player_mitigation_breakdown()` in the combat manager, combined multiplicatively
      the way the damage path actually applies it, so the number cannot drift from the real one.
      `-- statuschips` prints what both sides show.
- [ ] **Card-upgrade pick has no skill in it** (owner 2026-09-08: *"They effectively have no
      control of which 3 they are picking... a wasted interaction of seeing 9 that you have no bit
      of control in getting."*). The panel copied the loot minigame's Preview -> Shuffle -> Hunt
      SHAPE but not its skill layer: `_ms_order.shuffle()` rebuilds the grid instantly, so the
      cards TELEPORT and the preview is decoration. A 2026-09-04 pass noticed and honestly
      reworded the header rather than fixing the interaction.
      **The fix already exists in this codebase and the owner validated it in August**
      (`project_prize_shuffle_redesign`): `combat_loot_panel.gd` replays a SERVER-supplied `swaps`
      array as visible pairwise animations so a sharp player can follow one card, plus rare peek
      tokens; swap count scales with stakes (`3+tier`, cap 14). Port that.
      **Must be server-driven.** The milestone shuffle is client-side today, and animating a swap
      sequence the server did not author would be showing the player a lie - worse than the
      teleport. Owner is happy for this to come AFTER the release.
- [ ] **Buff panel, party half.** Same strip for each party member, plus a STACKING indicator.
- [x] **Card upgrade preview — DONE 2026-09-07.** The estimate counted `power` picks alone while
      the combat manager applied nine more multipliers from hard-coded literals, so five upgrades
      silently moved the real hit while the card kept printing its old number: Overdraw / Reckless
      / Brittle / Heavy Draw each add 25-35%, and **Slow Burn TAKES 25% away** with no visible
      change at all. Both sides now read one table, `CardUpgrades.DAMAGE_MULTS`.
      Conditional upgrades are deliberately EXCLUDED from the printed number and shown as their
      own "Situational: x1.4 foe under 30%" line — averaging a trigger into a flat number is wrong
      in both directions. The rank-up hover now shows the card WITH the pick on it
      ("412 -> 462 damage (+12%)") instead of the abstract "+12% effect", and Power's shrinking
      marginal gain is shown honestly because it rides the tier multiplier rather than compounding.
      `-- upgradepreview` drives the real roller 4000x per upgrade against what the card prints;
      worst gap 0.007.
- [x] **Trickster engine labels forked — DONE 2026-09-07** (owner: *"I'm good with forking it."*).
      All three read "Read" while warriors showed Momentum / Rage / Conviction and mages Focus /
      Volatility / Insight. It was wrong about the game, not just inconsistent: the finisher fork
      gave the three DIFFERENT shapes — the Grifter banks and cashes (Momentum-shaped), the Ranger
      ramps and discharges (Focus-shaped), and only the Ninja gambles on the bypass (Read-shaped).
      One noun for three mechanics. Now **Grifter = Leverage, Ranger = Aim, Ninja = Read** (the
      Ninja keeps the shape name, as Fighter/Momentum and Wizard/Focus do).
      Root cause of why it had nowhere to land: `update_read` was the only one of the three meter
      functions with no `label` parameter, and `read_label` was the only engine label the server
      never sent. Both fixed, so the label lives in one place.
      Swept all seven surfaces; `-- enginenames` now prints what each class is told and PASSES 9/9.
      **Mages have no engine log line on purpose** (2026-09-04, one-line-per-action) — the meter
      carries it; the audit encodes that so nobody "fixes" it later.
- [x] **Stale copy on the path buttons — DONE 2026-09-07.** The Trickster path still pitched
      *"Outwit, evade, or strike critically"* — selling **Outsmart**, retired 2026-09-05. All three
      path pitches now describe the loop the path actually plays. The help page's class overview
      was worse: it listed **Paladin = self-healing** (it is Retribution — Conviction built by
      blows you take) and **Sage = efficient** under its old name rather than the Oracle. All nine
      now name their engine there.
- [ ] **Death replay / shareable combat log.** When a player dies, the chat message carries a
      clickable link to the combat log — ideally a replay — so everyone can see how it happened.
- [ ] **Combat layout at 1080p — CONFIRM BEFORE BUILDING.** Owner 2026-09-08: *"needs confirmed
      before we work it. May not be an issue anymore."* The overlap was logged 2026-05-28 and the
      combat scene has been rebuilt several times since, so the report may already be stale.
      Capture first: `python tools/test_setup/shots.py combat` renders the real client at
      1920x1080 (SHOT_RES) into `claude_screenshots/`. Look at the image before writing any code;
      if the overlap is gone, close this item rather than "fixing" it.
- [ ] **Extend UI-scale registration** to the elements that still lack it (action bar, status HUD,
      inventory, market, crafting, sanctuary).

- [ ] **Dungeon level mismatch — BLOCKED, needs a second example.** Owner reported a 1-1 wolf
      dungeon advertising "recommended level 3" while floor-1 wolves were level 6. A real defect
      was found and fixed in v0.9.758 (the warning quoted `min_level`, a static field on the
      dungeon TYPE, while monsters are sized from the INSTANCE and scale per floor). But the
      specific 3-to-6 gap could NOT be reproduced: tier 1 sub-tier 1 computes to a level 1-2 band,
      so something else may also be involved. Owner 2026-09-08: *"something we will need another
      example of since you were unable to find its cause."* Do not guess at a second fix — wait
      for a repro with the DUNGEON NAME, then trace that instance's `dungeon_level`.

## Phase 4 — party (half-built; finish or cut)

- [ ] **Invite window** and **watch-a-teammate's-minigame** — the two remaining Party UI pieces.
- [ ] **Party fairness**: verify every member really receives combat rewards (especially equipment),
      rotate the leader between fights, consider splitting gathering/crafting/loot rewards.
- [ ] **"Party play isn't working properly"** (owner, 2026-08-26) — no repro captured. ASK for the
      symptom before investigating.
- [ ] **Leader logout must not strand the party.**

- [ ] **Companion card pass** (owner 2026-09-08: *"most companion cards are too weak to be viable
      or useful at all"*). Re-tune them so a companion card is worth a deck slot at all. **A small
      portion should offer STUN or DISTRACT** — that is what makes the `harrying` and
      `demoralising` upgrades viable for a Ranger or Ninja, neither of whom holds a rattling card
      (see the Phase 3 item). Do this BEFORE re-judging those upgrades.
- [ ] **Dungeon card pass** (same conversation): *"dungeon reward cards likely need reworked and
      added to add interesting new cards that classes may want to swap into their decks."* The bar
      is a card a player would CHOOSE over one of their five, which today almost none clear. Same
      note as above: some should rattle the enemy.

## Phase 5 — the dungeon arc (the big content direction)

- [ ] **Dungeon revamp** — owner wants dungeons changed "a good bit"; details not yet captured.
- [ ] **Dungeon-themed floor equipment** (owner 2026-09-08): *"higher chances for players to find
      floor equipment with affixes related to our matching the dungeon type. Example Balrog
      equipment in a Balrog dungeon."*
      The gap is small and precise, because **the pattern already exists one branch above it**:
      `server.gd::_roll_floor_item` receives `dungeon_type` AND `boss_egg_monster`, and the EGG
      branch uses them (floor eggs already match the dungeon type + tier). The equipment branch
      (`roll < 82`) calls `drop_tables.roll_dungeon_chest_equipment(tier, lvl)`, which takes only
      tier and level — so the dungeon's identity is in scope and thrown away.
      There is also a naming/affix pattern to copy rather than invent: `generate_arcane_hoarder_gear`
      / `generate_warrior_hoarder_gear` / `generate_trickster_gear` in `drop_tables.gd` already
      produce monster-flavoured items ("Arcane Hoarder's Ring of the Archon") with a level boost
      and their own affix roll. A Balrog's Depths run wants "Balrog's ..." on the same shape.
      Open questions to settle when this is picked up, NOT assumed now:
        * Does the theme drive a real AFFIX BIAS (fire/burn weighting in a lava dungeon) or only
          the name + a level/rarity boost? The owner said "affixes related to", so probably both.
        * How much higher is "higher chance"? Pick it against the drop-rate work, not by feel.
        * **Read `docs/design/equipment_reference.md` first** — the chase pool is epic+ only, and
          an item's class stats come from its BASE TYPE, not its affixes. Do not design a themed
          affix that no acquisition path can actually roll.
- [ ] **Dungeon Atlas** as hub + quest board.
- [ ] **Dungeon-centred questing** to replace the disliked overworld quests: clear / rescue /
      boss-hunt / gather.
- [ ] **Presentation pass**: map, minimap, GUI, and real in-game dungeon screenshots for the site.

## Phase 6 — realm meta and sinks

- [ ] **Real sinks for excess eggs and companions**: shops, breeders, trainers, fusers, companion
      tasks. Much is already scaffolded (fusion, breeder NPCs, egg market, kennel).
- [ ] **Living world / rework the posts.**
- [ ] **Launcher revamp + feedback inbox** — self-updating launcher, bigger window, changelog panel,
      and suggest-idea / report-issue buttons posting to a server inbox.

## Phase 7 — endgame: THE UNBURIED (deliberately later)

Owner 2026-09-07: not needed for a long while. It is the mechanism that makes the top of the ladder
reachable, so it pairs with revisiting the high-level win targets — but nothing depends on it yet.

An aspirational milestone admits a player to **The Unburied**: great powers that affect the realm
and other players, plus **3 extra lives**, and possibly a further life from a hard endgame loop
(deliberately not easy, so members are not effectively unkillable).

The name is exact against the setting bible: a phantom is a dead thing the ground refuses to keep
down, and these are the ones it keeps sending back — which is what extra lives ARE.

## Phase 8 — later / unscheduled

- [ ] **Prize Shuffle** loot-minigame redesign (combat done; gathering and crafting remain).
- [ ] **Crafting review** — owner: "not in a good spot at all."
- [ ] **Sanctuary redesign.**
- [ ] **Player phantoms.**
- [ ] **Minigame variety.**
- [ ] **Live smoke test of the card market** (built, compile-clean, never exercised end to end).

---

## Hard constraints — do not relearn these

- **A deck is 5 cards + the companion loaner.** Cards past that only make the ones you want come up
  less often. **Duplicates do not work** — the seeding loop assigns `collection[name] = 1`.
- **Exclusivity is the tuning lever.** A card only one class starts with can be tuned freely; a
  shared card cannot be tuned for one class without moving the others. That is why Killing Edge
  could fix the Ninja and its deck could not.
